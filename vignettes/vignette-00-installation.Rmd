## Quick installation

_slendr_ is available on the CRAN R package repository. As such, you can install it simply by executing `install.packages("slendr")` in your R console.

If you want (or need) to get its development version, you can install it directly from GitHub by executing `devtools::install_github("bodkan/slendr")` via the R package *devtools* (you can gen *devtools* by running `install.packages("devtools")`). In fact, if you decide to try _slendr_, please make sure to update it regularly and keep an eye on the [changelog](https://slendr.net/news/index.html) on a regular basis! This is where you can find information about latest bugfixes and potential breaking changes.

Once you install _slendr_, **calling `library(slendr)` will check that all software dependencies are available**. If they are not, the R package will provide a brief helpful guide on how to resolve potential issues. The rest of this vignette talks about the necessary software dependencies in a bit more detail.

**Please note that _slendr_ has been extensively tested only on macOS and Linux at the moment.** However, there is an experimental support for runnig both SLiM and *msprime* simulations on Windows and for analyzing tree-sequence outputs using its *tskit* interface on this platform as well. Feedback on issues with using _slendr_ on Windows is highly appreciated.

## Software dependencies

_slendr_ relies on three main software dependencies:

1.  geospatial data analysis R package [*sf*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) (for encoding spatial _slendr_ models and analysing spatial tree-sequence data),

2.  forward population genetic simulator [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/) (for forward simulations),

3.  Python modules [*tskit*, *msprime*, and *pyslim*](https://tskit.dev/) (for coalescent simulations and tree-sequence analysis), and also *pandas* used internally by the simulation back ends.

All three are widely used in their respective fields and, as such, are easily obtainable on all major operating systems (see below for more information on how to troubleshoot potential problems).

**Note that depending on your use case, not all three sets of dependencies will be necessarily needed.** If you're not going to be running forward spatial simulations, you don't need SLiM or geospatial R packages *sf*, *stars*, and *rnaturalearth*. This applies also to the animation of spatial models using the *gganimate* R package. **This is why _slendr_ does not install those as dependencies. If you need this functionality, you will have to install the respective R packages manually.**

In this vignette, I will briefly explain how to get all *slendr'*s software dependencies installed. That said, note that under normal circumstances (with the exception of SLiM), no manual installation of individual dependencies is required.

### *sf*, *stars*, *rnaturalearth*

The R package *sf* is at the heart of geospatial data analysis in R. It is available on CRAN and can be installed for all major platforms by executing `install.packages("sf")` in your R session. The same applies for *stars* and *rnaturalearth*.

When you first load _slendr_ via `library(slendr)`, if you're missing any of the three geospatial R packages, you will be notified and instructed how you can easily obtain them from CRAN using a single call to `install.packages()`.

That said, *sf* itself depends on a number of geospatial libraries and depending on the exact setup of your Linux or macOS machine, some of those libraries could be missing. Luckily, all of them are very easy to install via Homebrew (on macOS) or via the appropriate package manager of your Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.). Detailed instructions on how to do this for your operating system can be found [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html#installing).

**If you're having problems with the installation of any of these three packages, look for help [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html#installing).**

#### **macOS**

One user who recently installed _slendr_ on a fresh macOS system reported that they needed to install `libgit2` in order to be able to install the package *devtools* for the `devtools::install_github("bodkan/slendr")` step described on top of this page.

Additionally, they had to install a couple of C/C++ libraries as well (all dependencies of the *sf* package). In the end, they were able to successfully install _slendr_ after running:

```         
brew install libgit2 udunits gdal proj
```

Note that this assumes that you have the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager already setup on your Mac. If you're a beginning computational scientist using a Mac, I strongly encourage you to install Homebrew. Sooner or later you will need some specific Linux/unix program anyway, and Homebrew is the way to get it (Mac is a unix machine, but without Homebrew a very poor one by default).

#### **Linux**

Testing _slendr_ installation on a fresh, pristine Debian installation with no dependencies previously installed, I had to run the following:

```         
sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev libssl-dev libgdal-dev libgsl-dev libgit2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev
```

It's very unlikely you would need all of the above (and you might need other packages on non-Debian distributions), but this is what got _slendr_ and all of its dependencies running on a completely clean system. Might be a good start in case you have trouble on your Linux machine.

**Windows**

No special treatment should be necessary to get _slendr_ running. If you install _slendr_ via `install.packages("slendr")`, you will get the binary version of the package and all its dependencies without any need for compiling sources.

### SLiM

The forward population genetic software SLiM is available on all major software platforms. Its complete installation instructions can be found [here](https://messerlab.org/slim/). **On a Mac**, I recommend installing SLiM via the `pkg` installer available for direct download from its [website](https://messerlab.org/slim/). **On Linux**, you can either install SLiM via the appropriate package manager for your Linux distribution (see SLiM manual [here](https://messerlab.org/slim/) for more information), or you can easily compile your own. To install SLiM **on Windows**, please follow the instructions in section 2.3.1 of the SLiM manual. Note that although SLiM is also available on conda, it comes without SLiMgui!

Note that _slendr_ requires SLiM 4.0 and will not work with an earlier version. Again, running `library(slendr)` will inform you of any potential issues with your SLiM installation.

#### Adding SLiM to the `$PATH`

In order for _slendr_ to be able to find your SLiM installation, R must be able to find the `slim` binary (or `slim.exe` in case of Windows) in the so called [`$PATH` variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). The easiest way to verify that this is true is to call `Sys.which("slim")` (or `Sys.which("slim.exe")` on Windows) in your R session. For instance, on my own Mac, I get this:

```         
> Sys.which("slim")
                 slim 
"/usr/local/bin/slim" 
```

On Windows, I get this (I followed the section 2.3.1 of the SLiM manual describing the most "official" way to install SLiM and I recommend you follow this as well):

```         
> Sys.which("slim.exe")
                            slim.exe 
"C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin\\slim.exe" 
```

If, on the other hand, you might get something like this â€” an empty string:

```         
> Sys.which("slim")
slim 
  "" 
```

**This means that your `$PATH` R is not configured properly and R (and _slendr_) won't be able to find SLiM in the `$PATH`.**

How to add SLiM to the `$PATH` then? Probably the most convenient way to do this is by editing the `.Renviron` file. The precise location of this file depends on your operation system but you can automatically get it open in a text editor by using this command (you might have to do `install.packages("usethis")` first):

```         
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Then, you can either add the following (note that there's no `$` in this line!):

```         
PATH="<path to directory with SLiM binaries>"
```

Alternatively, should you already have some `$PATH` contents specified for your R session, you can get it by calling `Sys.getenv("PATH")` in your R console, grab the entire string you get in this way, and append the path where you installed SLiM using an appropriate delimiter (`:` on Linux/macOS, `;` on Windows) to this string. In this case, the edit might look something like this:

```         
PATH="<original Sys.getenv("PATH") content><delimiter><path to directory with SLiM binaries>"
```

For instance, on my Mac, the `.Renviron` file contains this line (note the last item `/usr/local/bin` matches the path to `slim` I showed above):

```         
PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/Users/mp/.my_local/bin:/Users/mp/.my_local/AdmixTools/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/opt/homebrew/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:/opt/homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/bin"
```

On my testing Windows machine, I have this in the `.Renviron` file (again, look for the path `C:/msys64/mingw64/bin;$PATH"` which matches the `slim.exe` binary shown above):

```         
PATH="C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin;C:\\rtools43\\x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix\\bin;C:\\rtools43\\usr\\bin;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\R\\R-4.3.2\\bin\\x64;C:/msys64/mingw64/bin"
```

**The most important check that your R can find SLiM is using the `Sys.which()` command described above. Before this gives you a positive result, you won't be able to use _slendr_'s spatial SLiM simulations*.* If you're struggling with this, search for advice related to `.Renviron` and `$PATH` online.**

##### Fallback options

If you don't want to deal with editing the `.Renviron` file, you should be able to set the path to SLiM using the command `Sys.setenv(PATH = "<path to directory with SLiM binaries>")`. You will have to do this at the beginning of each of your slendr R scripts though.

Alternatively, the `slim()` function has an argument `slim_path=` where you can specify the full path to the `slim` or `slim.exe` binaries directly (not the directory as it's the case with the `$PATH`! the full path to the `slim`/`slim.exe` binary itself).

### Python

In order to be able to run coalescent simulations and process tree-sequence files, _slendr_ needs Python modules *tskit*, *msprime*, and *pyslim* (it also needs the *pandas* library).

Setting up an isolated Python environment with specific version of Python packages (which is very important to avoid clashes among different Python programs needed by your system) can be a [bit of a hassle](https://xkcd.com/1987/) for some users. This is especially true for R users who might not use Python in their daily work.

In order to make sure that the R package has the most appropriate version of Python available, with the correct versions of all of its Python module dependencies, _slendr_ provides a dedicated function `setup_env()` which automatically **downloads a completely separate Python distribution and installs the required versions of *tskit*, *msprime*, and *pyslim* modules into a dedicated virtual environment**. Moreover, this Python installation and virtual environment are **entirely isolated from other Python configurations that are already present on the user's system**, avoiding potential conflicts with the versions of Python and Python modules required by _slendr_.

**Next time you call `library(slendr)`, you will need to activate this environment automatically by calling `init_env()`**. If you're not comfortable with Python you don't need to worryÂ beyond calling `setup_env()` and `init_env()`, no interaction with Python is necessary for working with _slendr_ in R.

#### Failing *conda*?

In order to support Windows, _slendr_ uses conda to download a Python interpreter as explained above. Given this fact, when you run `setup_env()`, _slendr_ tries to leverage conda being present to install its Python dependencies (*msprime*, *tskit*, *pyslim*, *pandas*) via conda itself.

Unfortunately, conda can break for frustratingly many random reasons which completely trips up `setup_env()`. If you run into this issue, **there is a fallback option to install Python dependencies *msprime*, *tskit*, *pyslim*, and *pandas* via `pip`** which, unlike conda, works practically every time. If your `setup_env()` fails for some conda-related reason, first clear the broken environment by calling `clear_env()`, restart your R session, and then **call `setup_env(pip = TRUE)`** instead of the default `setup_env()`. Note that **this might require you to install the [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) numerical library, but that's a trivial issue on macOS (`brew install gsl`) and Linux (on Ubuntu, for instance, `sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev`)**.

#### Information for Python experts

In case you are wondering how does _slendr_ accomplish the above: _slendr_'s Python interface is implemented using the R package [*reticulate*](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)*.* This embeds a Python interpreter *inside* an R session, enabling high-performance interoperability between both languages without any need for user intervention.

#### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tskit'` error

If you're running into this error, it means that _slendr_ was prevented from activating its internal Python virtual environment. Most likely you either didn't run `setup_env()` as described above, or you forgot to run `init_env()` before attempting to simulate tree sequence data, or the Python environment got somehow corrupted. All of these cause _slendr_'s internal machinery to fail to pick up it's Python dependencies for tree-sequence simulation and analysis, leading to the `No module named 'tskit'` error.

Before reporting this error on GitHub, please carefully read [this writeup](https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/issues/154#issuecomment-1997714497) which I put together when a user reported the same error. It contains all the required information on how does _slendr_'s Python environment activation works and why, and why you're running into the error. Because this issue is almost always caused by a problem outside of _slendr_'s influence, it's important that you understand what's going on before reporting what is often assumed to be a _slendr_ bug when in reality it isn't.
