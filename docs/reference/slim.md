# Run a slendr model in SLiM

This function will execute a SLiM script generated by the `compile`
function during the compilation of a slendr demographic model.

## Usage

``` r
slim(
  model,
  sequence_length,
  recombination_rate,
  samples = NULL,
  ts = TRUE,
  path = NULL,
  random_seed = NULL,
  method = c("batch", "gui"),
  verbose = FALSE,
  run = TRUE,
  slim_path = NULL,
  burnin = 0,
  max_attempts = 1,
  spatial = !is.null(model$world),
  coalescent_only = TRUE,
  locations = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- model:

  Model object created by the `compile` function

- sequence_length:

  Total length of the simulated sequence (in base-pairs)

- recombination_rate:

  Recombination rate of the simulated sequence (in recombinations per
  basepair per generation)

- samples:

  A data frame of times at which a given number of individuals should be
  remembered in the tree-sequence (see `schedule_sampling` for a
  function that can generate the sampling schedule in the correct
  format). If missing, only individuals present at the end of the
  simulation will be recorded in the final tree-sequence file.

- ts:

  Should a tree sequence be simulated from the model?

- path:

  Path to the directory where simulation result files will be saved. If
  `NULL`, this directory will be automatically created as a temporary
  directory. If `TRUE`, this path will be also returned by the function.
  If a string is given, it is assumed to be a path to a directory where
  simulation results will be saved. In this case, the function will
  return this path invisibly. Note that if a tree-sequence file should
  be simulated (along with other files, potentially), that tree-sequence
  file (named 'slim.trees' by default) will have to be explicitly loaded
  using [`ts_read()`](https://slendr.net/reference/ts_read.md).

- random_seed:

  Random seed (if `NULL`, a seed will be generated between 0 and the
  maximum integer number available)

- method:

  How to run the script? ("gui" - open in SLiMgui, "batch" - run on the
  command line)

- verbose:

  Write the log information from the SLiM run to the console (default
  `FALSE`)?

- run:

  Should the SLiM engine be run? If `FALSE`, the command line SLiM
  command will be printed (and returned invisibly as a character vector)
  but not executed.

- slim_path:

  Path to the appropriate SLiM binary (this is useful if the `slim`
  binary is not on the `$PATH`). Note that this argument must be
  specified if the function is being run on Windows.

- burnin:

  Length of the burnin (in model's time units, i.e. years)

- max_attempts:

  How many attempts should be made to place an offspring near one of its
  parents? Serves to prevent infinite loops on the SLiM backend. Default
  value is 1.

- spatial:

  Should the model be executed in spatial mode? By default, if a world
  map was specified during model definition, simulation will proceed in
  a spatial mode.

- coalescent_only:

  Should `initializeTreeSeq(retainCoalescentOnly = <...>)` be set to
  `TRUE` (the default) or `FALSE`? See "retainCoalescentOnly" in the
  SLiM manual for more detail.

- locations:

  If `NULL`, locations are not saved. Otherwise, the path to the file
  where locations of each individual throughout the simulation will be
  saved (most likely for use with `animate_model`).

## Value

A tree-sequence object loaded via Python-R reticulate interface function
`ts_read` (internally represented by the Python object
`tskit.trees.TreeSequence`). If the `path` argument was set, specifying
the directory where results should be saved, the function will return
this path as a single-element character vector.

## Details

The arguments `sequence_length` and `recombination_rate` can be omitted
for slendr models utilizing customized initialization of genomic
architecture. In such cases, users may either provide hard-coded values
directly through SLiM's `initializeGenomicElement()` and
`initializeRecombinationRate()` functions or utilize slendr's templating
functionality provided by its
[`substitute()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/substitute.html) function. When
`ts = TRUE`, the returning value of this function depends on whether or
not the `path` argument was set. If the user did provide the `path`
where output files should be saved, the path is returned (invisibly).
This is mostly intended to support simulations of customized user
models. If `path` is not set by the user, it is assumed that a
tree-sequence object is desired as a sole return value of the function
(when `ts = TRUE`) and so it is automatically loaded when simulation
finishes, or (when `ts = FALSE`) that only customized files are to be
produced by the simulation, in which the user will be loading such files
by themselves (and only the path is needed).

## Examples

``` r
init_env()
#> The interface to all required Python modules has been activated.

# load an example model
model <- read_model(path = system.file("extdata/models/introgression", package = "slendr"))

# afr and eur objects would normally be created before slendr model compilation,
# but here we take them out of the model object already compiled for this
# example (in a standard slendr simulation pipeline, this wouldn't be necessary)
afr <- model$populations[["AFR"]]
eur <- model$populations[["EUR"]]
chimp <- model$populations[["CH"]]

# schedule the sampling of a couple of ancient and present-day individuals
# given model at 20 ky, 10 ky, 5ky ago and at present-day (time 0)
modern_samples <- schedule_sampling(model, times = 0, list(afr, 5), list(eur, 5), list(chimp, 1))
ancient_samples <- schedule_sampling(model, times = c(30000, 20000, 10000), list(eur, 1))

# sampling schedules are just data frames and can be merged easily
samples <- rbind(modern_samples, ancient_samples)

# run a simulation using the SLiM back end from a compiled slendr model object and return
# a tree-sequence object as a result
ts <- slim(model, sequence_length = 1e5, recombination_rate = 0, samples = samples)

# simulated tree-sequence object can be saved to a file using ts_write()...
ts_file <- normalizePath(tempfile(fileext = ".trees"), winslash = "/", mustWork = FALSE)
ts_write(ts, ts_file)
# ... and, at a later point, loaded by ts_read()
ts <- ts_read(ts_file, model)
