Imagine following five demographic models describing changes population size abstract population:  models population size change events , depending specifics project, defined using different time units. work radiocarbon-dated samples ancient DNA might used thinking population history units “years present”—case, “present” time (bottom figure) time 0 earlier events specified “5000 years present”, etc. hand, interested modelling theoretical population, might want concern quite happy starting simulation “generation 1” continue specified “generation X”. slendr package makes extremely easy, can specify times whatever direction units want, long kept consistent populations events model. rather unique feature among popgen simulation software programs either make express model “generations forward direction”, explicitly convert time generations going backwards. previous section vignette shown SLiM msprime can used simulation backend. remainder vignette present additional analysis, demonstrating fact can express time models forward backward direction still run models slendr’s SLiM (forward simulator) msprime (backward simulator). Specifically, define five demographic models figure twice, different orientations time – forward backward. compute allele frequency spectrum simulation (five models, forward backward) verify forward backward pairs give result regardless whether use SLiM back end msprime backend.","code":""},{"path":"https://www.slendr.net/articles/vignette-07-backends.html","id":"model-definition","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Computing allele frequency spectra","what":"Model definition","title":"Simulating data with SLiM and msprime backends","text":"First, let’s define five population histories forward time direction: Now let’s flip flow time around define population histories units “time ago”: convenience, write helper function , given population history object (ten objects just ), compile slendr model, run SLiM msprime back ends, load tree sequence, compute allele frequency spectrum (AFS) . save us lots code repetition (always good thing), minimize chance copy-pasting bugs (definitely good thing!) compare AFS patterns across different models two slendr simulation back ends (according population genetics theory).

R package allows : Program demographic models, including population splits, population size changes, gene-flow events using extremely simple declarative language entirely R (see vignette example model-definition interface). Even complex models can written little code require bare minimum R programming knowledge (thing user needs know call R function R data frame look like). Execute slendr models using efficient, tailor-made SLiM msprime simulation scripts bundled R package. simulation engines save outputs form efficient tree-sequence data structure. SLiM msprime programming needed! Load, process, analyse tree-sequence outputs via slendr’s built-R interface tree-sequence library tskit. can compute many population genetic statistics R immediately simulation finishes directly output tree sequences, without convert files formats (VCF, EIGENSTRAT) analysis different software. Encode complex models population movements landscape (see brief example model , extended explanation tutorial). knowledge cartographic geospatial analysis concepts needed. Simulate dynamic spatial demographic models using SLiM’s continuous-space simulation capabilities directly R (, SLiM programming required). outputs simulations saved tree sequences can analysed using standard R geospatial data analysis libraries. slendr performs conversion tree sequence tables appropriate spatial R data type automatically. Specify within-population individual dispersal dynamics R interface leveraging SLiM’s individual interaction parameters implemented SLiM back-end script. Schedule sampling events specify many individuals’ genomes, populations, times (optionally, locations) recorded simulation engine (SLiM msprime) output tree-sequence files. Utilizing flexibility R wealth libraries statistics, geospatial analysis graphics, combining power population genetic simulation frameworks SLiM msprime, slendr R package makes possible write entire simulation analytic pipelines without need leave R environment.","code":""},{"path":"https://www.slendr.net/index.html","id":"testing-the-r-package-in-an-online-rstudio-session","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Testing the R package in an online RStudio session","title":"A Simulation Framework for Spatiotemporal Population Genetics","text":"can open RStudio session test examples vignettes directly web browser clicking button (installation needed!):  case RStudio instance appears starting slowly, please patient (Binder freely available service limited computational resources provided community).

(PR #102) Motivation change: small proportion users experiencing issues broken conda environments various issues Python virtual environments general. ’s hard guess frequent , experience workshops courses suggests perhaps 1 20 users experiencing Python issues hindered ability use slendr .(Fun fact: first user-submitted GitHub issue upon releasing first version slendr R package … Python virtual environment issue). Explanation: Activating Python environments automatically upon calling library(slendr) popular feature hid away complexities R-Python interface powers slendr’s tree-sequence functionality. particularly convenient many slendr users, particularly experience Python . Unfortunately, cases Python virtual environments tskit/msprime/pyslim user’s system ended corrupted (anything else Python level got broken), automatic Python environment activation performed library(slendr) call failed slendr even loaded. Sadly, completely pulled rug slendr nothing done perspective (issue happened low-level layer embedded-Python slendr ’ve loaded R). Solving issues difficult experienced users, many slendr users experience Python , never used conda, don’t understand concept “Python virtual environments” R-Python interface works. ! , slendr R package. Splitting Python virtual environment activation step init_env() function means library(slendr) now always succeeds (regardless potential underlying Python issues user’s sytem), making much easier diagnose fix Python problems R package loaded. , recap: library(slendr) longer activates slendr’s isolated Python virtual environment. order simulate tree sequences analyse using interface tskit, necessary call init_env(). function performs Python-activation steps library(slendr) used call automagically earlier slendr versions. change scripts necessary.

Please consider option experimental time-hard predict edge cases might break (unit tests documentation tests passing though). Feedback welcome. (PR #112). now possible label groups samples slendr’s tskit interface functions make data frames statistics results readable. example, running ts_f3(ts, = c(\"p1_1\", \"p1_2\", \"p1_3\"), B = c(\"p2_1\", \"p2_3\"), C = c(\"p3_1\", \"p3_2\", \"p3_\")) resulted following data-frame output: gets unwieldy rather quickly, especially dozens hundreds samples grouped together populations. new syntax allows following shortcut via customised group names leveraging standard named list functionality R: readable line tskit-interface functions slendr used functionality via sample_sets = argument (ts_divergence(), ts_diversity(), etc.).
