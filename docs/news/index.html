<ul><li><p>Due to new issues related to conda activating environments in an incorrect path which <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/issues/179" class="external-link">started to pop up</a> (possibly due to a misfeature in the <em>reticulate</em> package), activating procedure in <em>slendr</em> was reverted to a slower, but apparently <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/182/commits/de868c160fb8eafd278676b98fd99edc90373c61" class="external-link">more robust approach</a>. This will unfortunately make running massively parallelized simulations on Windows problematic due to a suspected-but-hard-to-detect race condition in conda on Windows, which manifested when executing many parallel environment activations (one for each simulation process) on this platform. For the time being, users are advised to execute big parallelized simulations (we’re talking thousands of simulations in an ABC setting) on unix systems.

<p>A relatively modest release, mostly pushed out to keep <em>slendr</em> in step with the recent release of SLiM 5.0 and new releases of <em>msprime</em> and <em>tskit</em>. As a result, <em>slendr</em>’s SLiM-based functionality (and particularly its new “SLiM extension” mechanism) requires SLiM 5.0</p>
<ul><li><p>SLiM 5 is now required to run <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> simulations with <em>slendr</em>. Similarly, <em>tskit</em> and <em>msprime</em> have been upgraded to versions 0.6.4 and 1.3.4, respectively. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/173" class="external-link">PR </a><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/issues/173" class="external-link">#173</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/schedule_sampling.html">schedule_sampling()</a></code> now checks that all sampled populations are actually present in the compiled model (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/97abf75" class="external-link">#97abf75</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Data frames produced by <code><a href="../reference/ts_tracts.html">ts_tracts()</a></code> on <em>slendr</em>-produced tree sequences now include a time of a recorded sample carrying a given tract (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/a28b264" class="external-link">#a28b264</a>) and a user-friendly haplotype number (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/9c4724" class="external-link">#9c4724</a>) to which the tract belongs (i.e., either number 1 or 2, depending on the respective chromosome of a simulated individual).</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/ts_vcf.html">ts_vcf()</a></code> is now more robust (and more useful) in handling both <em>slendr</em> and non-<em>slendr</em> tree sequences. However, please take note of some potentially problematic situations involved in the <em>tskit</em> VCF conversion method, and solutions discussed <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/issues/167" class="external-link">here</a>. Until this is all resolve, consider <code><a href="../reference/ts_vcf.html">ts_vcf()</a></code> in its current form rather experimental. Also, as a reminder, note that you can always use Python <em>tskit</em> functionality functionality directly from R, using the <em>reticulate</em> interface. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/c26907" class="external-link">#c26907</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>By default, <code><a href="../reference/ts_vcf.html">ts_vcf()</a></code> now automatically transforms a site with coordinate 0 to 1. This is done to make sure that the produced VCF file adheres to the VCF specification. See <a href="https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/issues/2838" class="external-link">relevant discussion</a> in the <em>tskit</em> repository for more information.

<li><p><code><a href="../reference/get_python.html">get_python()</a></code> now replaces a <code>get_env()</code> function introduced in an earlier release. This function returns the full path to a Python binary which is part of the <em>slendr</em> virtual Python environment. As such, it can be directly ran on the command line, and the resulting Python session will have all of the <em>slendr</em> Python dependencies (<em>tskit</em>, <em>msprime</em>, etc.) available for import. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/a76d3f" class="external-link">#a76d3f</a>)</p></li>

<ul><li><strong>A massive update introducing the possibility of simulating non-neutral <em>slendr</em> models with <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> has been introduced. This update is too big to describe in the changelog – for more information and motivation, see the <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/155" class="external-link">description in the associated PR</a>, or <a href="https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-11-extensions.html">the new extensive vignette</a> on the topic. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/155" class="external-link">PR </a><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/issues/155" class="external-link">#155</a>)</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>Implementing changes for the v1.0 release (particularly the support for non-neutral models) required changing <em>slendr</em> internals at a very low level across the whole codebase. Feedback on this functionality, missing features, and bug reports are highly appreciated!</strong></p>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The behavior previously implemented via the <code>output =</code> and <code>ts =</code> arguments of <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> (and <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code>) has been changed to facilitate more straightforward handling of output paths in user-defined SLiM extensions and other packages leveraging <em>slendr</em> for inference. The <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code> function interfaces are now simplified in the following way:</p>
<ul><li>
<code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code>: the <code>ts</code> argument is now logical. <code>TRUE</code> switches on tree-sequence recording, <code>FALSE</code> switches it off. If tree-sequence recording is on (the default setting), the function automatically returns a tree-sequence R object. If users want to save it to a custom location, they should use the function <code><a href="../reference/ts_write.html">ts_write()</a></code> on the returned tree-sequence object. If customized output files are to be produced via user-defined extension scripts, those scripts can use a <em>slendr</em>/SLiM constant <code>PATH</code>, which is always available in the built-in SLiM script and which can be set from R via <code>slim(..., path = &lt;path to a directory&gt;)</code>. In that case, the <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> function always returns that path back. Crucially, in this case <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> will not return a tree sequence object, but that object can be loaded by <code>ts_read("&lt;path to a directory&gt;/slim.trees")</code>. In other words, nothing changes for the usual SLiM-based <em>slendr</em> workflow, but for models generating custom output files, a small amount of work is needed to load the tree sequence – the tree-sequence file outputs are therefore treated exactly the same way as non-tree-sequence user-defined output files. As a result of these changes, <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> no longer accepts a <code>load = TRUE|FALSE</code> argument.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>The above is implemented in PR <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/157" class="external-link">#157</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p><code><a href="../reference/ts_genotypes.html">ts_genotypes()</a></code> now works even for non-<em>slendr</em> tree sequences, which do not have <em>slendr</em> individual names of samples in the <code><a href="../reference/ts_nodes.html">ts_nodes()</a></code> output. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/d348ec" class="external-link">#d348ec</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Due to frequent issues with installation of Python dependencies of <em>slendr</em> in a completely platform independent way (in the latest instance this being conda installation of pyslim crashing on M-architecture Macs), <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code> now only uses conda to install <em>msprime</em> and <em>tskit</em> – <em>pyslim</em> and <em>tspop</em> are always installed via pip regardless of whether <code>setup_env(pip = FALSE)</code> (the default) or <code>setup_env(pip = TRUE)</code> is used. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/408948" class="external-link">#408948</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>A new function <code><a href="../reference/extract_parameters.html">extract_parameters()</a></code> can extract parameters of either a compiled <em>slendr</em> model object or a tree sequence simulated from a <em>slendr</em> model. This can be useful particularly for simulation-based inferences where model parameters are often drawn from random distributions and there’s a need to know which parameters of a model (split times, gene-flow rates, etc.) have been drawn. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/3632bd0" class="external-link">#3632bd0</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/compile_model.html">compile_model()</a></code> now allows to specify a description of time units used while scheduling <em>slendr</em> model events. This has purely descriptive purpose – in particular, these units are used in model plotting functions, etc. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/9b5b7ea0" class="external-link">#9b5b7ea0</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>slim_script</code> argument of <code><a href="../reference/compile_model.html">compile_model()</a></code> has been replaced by <code>extension</code> argument, which allows users to provide their custom-designed SLiM snippets for extending the behavior of <em>slendr</em>’s SLiM simulation engine. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/d11ac7" class="external-link">#d11ac7</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>sim_length</code> argument of <code><a href="../reference/compile_model.html">compile_model()</a></code> has been removed following a long period of deprecatiaon. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/12da50" class="external-link">#12da50</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>When a named list of samples is used as <code>X</code> input to <code><a href="../reference/ts_f4ratio.html">ts_f4ratio()</a></code>, the name of the element is used in the <code>X</code> column of the resulting data frame. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/0571a6" class="external-link">#0571a6</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/ts_table.html">ts_table()</a></code> can now extract the “sites” <em>tskit</em> table as <code>ts_table(ts, "sites")</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/e708f2" class="external-link">#e708f2</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>When applied to <em>slendr</em> tree sequences, <code><a href="../reference/ts_recapitate.html">ts_recapitate()</a></code> no longer issues the warning: <code>TimeUnitsMismatchWarning: The initial_state has time_units=ticks but time is measured in generations in msprime. This may lead to significant discrepancies between the timescales. If you wish to suppress this warning, you can use, e.g., warnings.simplefilter('ignore', msprime.TimeUnitsMismatchWarning)</code>. For <em>slendr</em> tree sequences, ticks are the same thing as generations anyway. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/43c45083" class="external-link">#43c45083</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Running <code>slim(..., method = "gui")</code> was broken due to recent changes to make <em>slendr</em> work on Windows. A path to a generated SLiM script executed in SLiMgui was incorrectly normalized. Non-SLiMgui runs were not affected. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/ccae1df" class="external-link">#ccae1df</a>)</p></li>

<li><p><code><a href="../reference/clear_env.html">clear_env()</a></code> now has a new argument <code>all = (TRUE|FALSE)</code> which allows deleting all <em>slendr</em> Python environments.

A fallback option in the form of the <code>slim_path=</code> argument of the <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> function can be used in non-standard SLiM installation circumstances.

<li><p>A trivial change has been made to <em>slendr</em>’s SLiM back-end script fixing the issue introduced in a SLiM 4.1 upgrade (see changelog for version 0.8.1 below).

<strong>Starting from this release, the *spatial* simulation and data analysis functionality of <em>slendr</em> is conditional on the presence of R geospatial packages <em>sf</em>, <em>stars</em>, and <em>rnaturalearth</em> on the system. This means that users will be able to install <em>slendr</em> (and use all of its non-spatial functionality) even without having these R packages installed. That said, nothing really changes in practice: spatial features of <em>slendr</em> are just one <code>install.packages(c("sf", "stars", "rnaturalearth"))</code> away! The difference is that <em>slendr</em> doesn’t try to do this during its own installation, but users are instructed to do this themselves (if needed) when the package is loaded.</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/7a10ea" class="external-link">#7a10ea</a>)</li>
</ul><p>If spatial dependencies are not present but a spatial <em>slendr</em> function is called regardless (such as <code><a href="../reference/world.html">world()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/move.html">move()</a></code>, etc.), an error message is printed with an information on how to install spatial dependencies via <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html" class="external-link">install.packages()</a></code> as above.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> It’s true that the main reason for <em>slendr</em>’s existence is its ability to simulate spatio-temporal data on realistic landscapes via SLiM. However, in practice, most of the “average” uses of <em>slendr</em> in the wild (and in classrooms!) rely on its traditional, non-spatial interface, with its spatial features being used comparatively rarely at the moment (except for some cutting-edge exploratory research). Given that setting up all of the spatial dependencies can be a bit of a hurdle, we have decided to make these dependencies optional, rather than force <em>every</em> user to go through the process of their installation whether they need the spatial features or not.</p>
<ul><li><p>A function <code><a href="../reference/check_dependencies.html">check_dependencies()</a></code> is now exported and can be used to check whether a <em>slendr</em> Python environment () or SLiM () are present. This is useful for other software building upon <em>slendr</em>, normal users can freely ignore this. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/6ae6ce" class="external-link">#6ae6ce</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>A path to a file from which a tree sequence was loaded from is now tracked internally via a <code>attr(&lt;tree sequence&gt;, "path")</code> attribute. Note that this has been implemented for the purposes of clean up for large-scale simulation studies (such as those facilitated by <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/demografr/" class="external-link"><em>demografr</em></a>) as a mostly internal feature, and should be considered experimental.

All <em>slendr</em> teaching material and most actively used research codebases I know of use the latter, more explicit, pipeline approach anyway, and this has been the one example where reduncancy does more harm than good.

<p>This is a relatively large update, which unfortunately had to be released in haste due to the <a href="https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html" class="external-link">retirement of the <em>rgdal</em> package</a> – a significant dependency of the entire spatial R ecosystem which is being phased out in the effort to move towards modern low-level geospatial architecture. Although <em>slendr</em> itself does not depend on <em>rgdal</em>, many of its dependencies used to (but won’t in the short term, hence the push to remove the <em>rgdal</em> dependency). The most significant update has been the addition of IBD functionality of <em>tskit</em>, as described below. However, large part of this functionality has not been extensively tested and should be considered extremely experimental at this stage. If you would like to use it, it might be safer to either wait for a later release in which the IBD functionality will be more stable, or use the underlying, battle-tested <a href="https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/python-api.html#tskit.TreeSequence.ibd_segments" class="external-link">Python implementation in <em>tskit</em></a>.</p>

<li><p>Population names are now restricted to only those strings which are also valid Python identifiers. Although this restriction is only needed for the msprime back end of <em>slendr</em> (not SLiM), it makes sense to keep things tidy and unified.

<strong><u>Minor breaking change!</u> Python environments of <em>slendr</em> are no longer automatically activated upon calling <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code>! Using the coalescent <em>msprime</em> back end and <em>slendr</em>’s tree-sequence functions now requires making an explicit call to a new function <code><a href="../reference/init_env.html">init_env()</a></code> after <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code> is executed.</strong> (PR <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/118" class="external-link">#102</a>)</li>
</ul><p>Motivation for the change: A small proportion of users have been experiencing issues with broken conda environments and various other issues with Python virtual environments in general. It’s hard to guess how frequent this has been, but experience from workshops and courses suggests perhaps 1 in 20 of users experiencing Python issues which hindered their ability to use <em>slendr</em> .(Fun fact: the first user-submitted GitHub issue upon releasing the first version of the <em>slendr</em> R package was… a Python virtual environment issue).</p>
<p>Explanation: Activating Python environments automatically upon calling <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code> has been a popular feature because it hid away most of the complexities of the R-Python interface that powers <em>slendr</em>’s tree-sequence functionality. This was particularly convenient for many <em>slendr</em> users, particularly those who have no experience with Python at all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in cases where a Python virtual environments with tskit/msprime/pyslim on a user’s system ended up corrupted (or if anything else at the Python level got broken), the automatic Python environment activation performed by the <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code> call failed and <em>slendr</em> was not even loaded. Sadly, this completely pulled the rug from under <em>slendr</em> and there was nothing that could be done about it from its perspective (the issue happened at a low-level layer of embedded-Python before <em>slendr</em> could’ve been loaded into R). Solving these issues was not difficult for experienced users, but many <em>slendr</em> users have no experience with Python at all, they have never used conda, they don’t understand the concept of “Python virtual environments” or how the R-Python interface works. And nor should they! After all, <em>slendr</em> is an R package.</p>
<p>Splitting the Python virtual environment activation step into its own <code><a href="../reference/init_env.html">init_env()</a></code> function means that <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code> now always succeeds (regardless of potential underlying Python issues on a user’s sytem), making it much easier to diagnose and fix Python problems from R once the package is loaded.</p>
<p>So, to recap: <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code> no longer activates <em>slendr</em>’s isolated Python virtual environment. In order to simulate tree sequences and analyse them using its interface to <em>tskit</em>, it is necessary to call <code><a href="../reference/init_env.html">init_env()</a></code>. This function performs the same Python-activation steps that <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code> used to call automagically in earlier <em>slendr</em> versions. No other change to your scripts is necessary.</p>
<ul><li><p>Related to the previous point: <em>slendr</em> now requires Python 3.11, msprime 1.2.0, tskit 0.5.4, and pyslim 1.0.1, to keep up with recent releases of its Python dependencies. Again, this presents no hassle to the user, and the only thing required is re-running <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code>. (PR <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/121" class="external-link">#112</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>When a named list is provided as a <code>sample_sets =</code> argument to a oneway statistic function, the names are used in a <code>set</code> column of the resulting data frame even if only single samples were used. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/2a6781" class="external-link">#2a6781</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>It is now possible to have non-spatial populations in an otherwise spatial model. Of course, when plotting such models on a map, only spatial components of the model will be plotted and <em>slendr</em> will give a warning. To be absolutely sure that users intends to do this, <em>slendr</em> will also give a warning when running <code><a href="../reference/compile_model.html">compile_model()</a></code> on models like this. Please consider this option experimental for the time-being as it is hard to predict which edge cases might break because of this (all unit tests and documentation tests are passing though). Feedback is more than welcome. (PR <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/121" class="external-link">#112</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>It is now possible to label groups of samples in <em>slendr</em>’s <em>tskit</em> interface functions which should make data frames with statistics results more readable. As an example, running <code>ts_f3(ts, A = c("p1_1", "p1_2", "p1_3"), B = c("p2_1", "p2_3"), C = c("p3_1", "p3_2", "p3_"))</code> resulted in a following data-frame output:</p></li>
</ul><pre><code>&gt; ts_f3(ts, A = c("p1_1", "p1_2", "p1_3", "p1_4", "p1_5"),
            B = c("p2_1", "p2_2", "p2_3"),
            C = c("p3_1", "p3_2", "p3_3", "p3_4"))

# A tibble: 1 × 4
  A                        B              C                         f3
  &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;
1 p1_1+p1_2+p1_3+p1_4+p1_5 p2_1+p2_2+p2_3 p3_1+p3_2+p3_3+p3_4 0.000130</code></pre>
<p>This gets unwieldy rather quickly, especially when dozens or hundreds of samples are grouped together as populations. The new syntax allows the following shortcut via customised group names leveraging the standard named <code>list</code> functionality in R:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ts_f3(ts, A = list(group_one = c("p1_1", "p1_2", "p1_3", "p1_4", "p1_5")),
            B = list(group_two = c("p2_1", "p2_2", "p2_3")),
            C = list(group_three = c("p3_1", "p3_2", "p3_3", "p3_4")))
# A tibble: 1 × 4
  A         B         C                 f3
  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;
1 group_one group_two group_three 0.000130</code></pre>
<p>This is more readable and in line with some other <em>tskit</em>-interface functions of <em>slendr</em> which used this functionality via their <code>sample_sets =</code> argument (<code><a href="../reference/ts_divergence.html">ts_divergence()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/ts_diversity.html">ts_diversity()</a></code>, etc.). (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/ac5e484" class="external-link">#ac5e484</a>)</p>
<ul><li>The default state of the <code>parent =</code> argument of <code><a href="../reference/population.html">population()</a></code> is now <code>NULL</code> instead of <code>"ancestor"</code>. This prevents silly surprising clashes in situation where some population’s name really <em>is</em> “ancestor”. The only change internally is that for populations which are ancestral, the <code>splits</code> data frame element of a <em>slendr</em> model object which includes this population carries a formal “ancestral parent population” as <code>"__pop_is_ancestor"</code> instead of just <code>"ancestor"</code>. Note that this is an internal implementation detail and not something that particularly has to involve the user. Still, if you have been somehow using <em>slendr</em>’s internal data structures, keep this in mind. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/f8a39a2" class="external-link">#f8a39a2</a>)</li>

<ul><li><p>The <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code> function now makes sure that a given <em>slendr</em> model can fully coalesce to a single common ancestor population. Previously, having multiple ancestral populations created with <code>parent = "ancestor"</code> would cause an infinite simulation when plugged into the <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code> backend. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/095b124" class="external-link">#095b124</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The initial size of a population which emerges from a split from another population is now printed in a population history summary in the R console. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/6525bf3" class="external-link">#6525bf3</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of fixes to support loading, processing, and plotting of “manually” created tree sequences have been implemented (see <a href="https://tskit.dev/tutorials/tables_and_editing.html#constructing-a-tree-sequence" class="external-link">this</a>). Not sure how practically useful, but it’s important to be able to load even “pure” tree sequences which are not from simulators such as SLiM and msprime. A set of <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/blob/main/tests/testthat/test-manual-ts.R" class="external-link">unit tests</a> has been added, making sure that a minimalist nodes &amp; edges table can be loaded, as well as nodes &amp; edges &amp; individuals, plus tables of populations and sites &amp; mutations. PRs with more extensive unit tests and bug reports of tree sequences which are failing to load would be appreciated! The code for handling cases of “manually-created” tree sequences which have missing individual table, missing populations table, etc. seems especially brittle at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/79adf14" class="external-link">#79adf14</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>-1</code> value as a missing value indicator used in tskit is now replaced with the more R-like <code>NA</code> in various tree-sequence tables (annotated by <em>slendr</em> or original through tskit itself) (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/79adf14" class="external-link">#79adf14</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Relative paths are now expanded in <code><a href="../reference/ts_write.html">ts_write()</a></code> (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/382e0b7" class="external-link">#382e0b7</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><em>slendr</em> models can now be optionally compiled without serialization to disk. This only works with the <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code> coalescent back end but will be much faster in cases where a huge number of simulations needs to be run because for non-serialized models, <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code> now calls the back end engine directly through the R-Python interface (rather than on the command line) and output tree sequences are not saved to disk, rather than passed through the Python-R interface directly in memory (PR <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/112" class="external-link">#112</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Deprecated argument <code>sampling =</code> of the functions <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code> has now been permanently removed in favour of the <code>samples =</code> argument (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/0757b6e" class="external-link">#0757b6e</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid the unnecessary <code>array</code> type of <em>tskit</em> results returned via reticulate. Numeric vectors (columns of data frames with numerical results) obtained in this way are simple R numeric vector (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/5101b39" class="external-link">#5101b39</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>One-way and multi-way statistics results are now returned as simple numerical vectors. Previously, results were returned as a type <code>array</code> despite “looking” as vectors (this is how values are returned to R from the reticulate-Python layer), which caused unnecessary annoyances and type-conversions on the R side of things and was not even intended (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/403df3b" class="external-link">#403df3b</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Computing population genetic statistics on named samples that are not present in a tree sequence (most likely typos) is now correctly caught and reported as an error (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/da7e0bb" class="external-link">#da7e0bb</a>).</p></li>

<ul><li><p>SLiM 4.0 is now required for running simulations with the <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> engine. If you want to run <em>slendr</em> simulations with SLiM (spatial or non-spatial), you will need to upgrade you SLiM installation. SLiM 3.7.1 version is no longer supported as the upcoming new <em>slendr</em> spatial features will depend on SLiM 4.x and maintaining two functionally identical yet syntactically different back ends is not feasible (PR <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/104" class="external-link">#104</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>At the same time as the SLiM 4.0 release, new versions of Python modules msprime, tskit and pyslim have also been released. In fact, to be able to work with SLiM 4.0 tree sequences properly, those Python modules must be upgraded as well. Next time you load <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code>, you will be prompted to setup a new updated Python environment which you can do easily by running <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental support for running coalescent msprime simulations and analysing tree-sequence data using tskit on the Windows platform has now been implemented (PR <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/102" class="external-link">#102</a>).</p></li>

<ul><li><p><em>slendr</em> is now <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=slendr" class="external-link">on CRAN</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>Big changes to the way tree-sequence outputs are handled by <em>slendr</em> by default. See <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/100#issue-1310869866" class="external-link">this comment</a> for an extended description and examples of the change. (PR <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/100" class="external-link">#100</a>). Briefly, simulation functions <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code> now return a tree-sequence object by default (can be switched off by setting <code>load = FALSE</code>), avoiding the need to always run <code>ts &lt;- ts_read(model)</code> as previously. At the same time, a parameter <code>output =</code> can be now used in <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code> to specify the location where a tree-sequence file should be saved (temporary file by default).</p></li>
<li><p><em>slendr</em>’s tree-sequence R interface to the <a href="https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/introduction.html" class="external-link">tskit</a> Python module has been generalized to load, process, and analyze tree sequences from non-<em>slendr</em> models!** This means that users can use the <em>slendr</em> R package even for analyzing tree sequences coming from standard msprime and SLiM scripts, including all spatial capabilities that have been only available for <em>slendr</em> tree sequences so far. Please note that this generalization is still rather experimental and there might be corner cases where a tree sequence from your msprime or SLiM script does not load properly or leads to other errors. If this happens, please open a GitHub issue with the script in question attached. (PR <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/pull/91" class="external-link">#91</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Removed functions and some function arguments originally deprecated during the renaming phase of the pre-preprint refactoring. This affects <code>compile</code>, <code>boundary</code>, <code>dispersal</code>, <code>expand</code>, <code>geneflow</code>, <code>plot.slendr</code>, <code>plot_graph</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>sampling</code>, and <code>shrink</code>. Similarly, deprecated <code>dir</code> argument of the <code>compile_model</code> is now <code>path</code>, <code>geneflow</code> argument of <code>compile_model</code> is now <code>gene_flow</code>, and the <code>_dist</code> suffix was removed from <code>competition_dist</code>, <code>mate_dist</code>, and <code>dispersal_dist</code>. If you get an error about a missing function or a function argument in code which used to work in an ancient version of <em>slendr</em>, this is why. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/985b451" class="external-link">#985b451</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>When setting up an isolated Python environment using <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code>, <em>slendr</em> now makes a decision whether to install Python dependencies using pip (critical on osx-arm64 for which the conda msprime/tskit are unfortunately currently broken) or with conda (every other platform). This can be still influenced by the user using the <code>pip = &lt;TRUE|FALSE&gt;</code> argument, but we now change the default behavior on ARM64 Mac. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/54a413d" class="external-link">#54a413d</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The name of the default <em>slendr</em> Python environment is now shortened even more, and the redundant <code>_pandas</code> prefix is now dropped. <strong>Users will be notified upon calling <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code> that a new environment should be created. This is OK, it’s not a bug.</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/54a413d" class="external-link">#54a413d</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The format of the default <em>slendr</em> Python environment is now <code>msprime-&lt;version&gt;_tskit-&lt;version&gt;_pyslim-&lt;version&gt;_pandas</code>, dropping the <code>slendr_</code> prefix. This paves the way towards a future non-<em>slendr</em> tskit R package, which will share the same Python environment with <em>slendr</em> (because both R packages will go hand in hand). This isn’t really a user-facing change, except that calling <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code> will suggests creating a new Python environment and <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code> will appear as if a <em>slendr</em> environment is not yet present. Calling <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code> and creating a new Python environment from scratch will solve the problem. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/eb05180" class="external-link">#eb05180</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code>xrange</code> and <code>yrange</code> parameters of <code><a href="../reference/world.html">world()</a></code> are now enforced to be two-dimensional numeric vectors, avoiding unnecessary issues with misspecified longitude/latitude (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/df95369" class="external-link">#df95369</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The argument <code>sampling =</code> in <code><a href="../reference/slim.html">slim()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/msprime.html">msprime()</a></code> is now renamed to <code>samples =</code> (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/adf4e0d" class="external-link">#adf4e0d</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The automated <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code> function for creating dedicated mini Python environments for <em>slendr</em> now installs packages using <em>pip</em> by default. Reason: The rate of conda failures and dependency conflicts (even in the trivial case of installing nothing more than <em>msprime</em> + <em>tskit</em> + <em>pyslim</em> + <em>pandas</em>) is too high to rely on it. The option to use conda for package installations with <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code> is still there, but the users must explicitly call <code>setup_env(pip = FALSE)</code> to get this behavior. Note that conda is still used as a means to install Python itself! This change only affects the way how Python modules are installed into a dedicated <em>slendr</em> Python environment, not the installation of Python itself. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/81be1a7" class="external-link">#81be1a7</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The name of the automatically created <em>slendr</em>-specific Python environment is now composed from the names <em>and versions</em> of Python modules installed. This makes it possible to naturally upgrade both <em>slendr</em> and its Python dependencies in case the <em>tskit</em> / <em>msprime</em> / <em>pyslim</em> folks upgrade some of those packages. In that case, if a <em>slendr</em> user upgrades the <em>slendr</em> package (and that new version requires newer versions of Python modules), <em>slendr</em> will simply recommend to create a new Python environment without additional effort on our part. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/81be1a7" class="external-link">#81be1a7</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The code of <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code> was simplified to bare essentials. Now it <em>only</em> serves as a way to auto-setup a dedicated, isolated Python installation and <em>slendr</em> environment. The interface to install Python modules into custom-defined Python environment created outside R has been removed because this functionality is not necessary – these custom environments can be easily activated by calling <code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/use_python.html" class="external-link">reticulate::use_virtualenv</a></code> or <code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/use_python.html" class="external-link">reticulate::use_condaenv</a></code>. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/30f24b9" class="external-link">#30f24b9</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>If some Python users want to use custom Python environments with <em>msprime</em>, <em>tskit</em>, and <em>pyslim</em>, they can silence the suggestion to use <code><a href="../reference/setup_env.html">setup_env()</a></code> printed by the <code><a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr" class="external-link">library(slendr)</a></code> call by setting <code>options(slendr.custom_env = TRUE)</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/30f24b9" class="external-link">#30f24b9</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The argument <code>sim_length =</code> is now renamed to <code>simulation_length =</code>. Both are accepted for the moment and using the old name will simply inform the user of the future deprecation. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/56491fb" class="external-link">#56491fb</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Extensive set of runnable examples including figures and a built-in pre-compiled example model have been added to the documentation. (<a href="https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/commit/395df62c" class="external-link">#395df62c</a>)</p></li>
