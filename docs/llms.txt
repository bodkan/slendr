# *slendr*: Population Genetic Simulations in R

### *Overview* [](https://slendr.net)

*slendr* is a toolbox for running population genomic simulations
entirely in R. Our original motivation for developing it was to provide
a framework for [simulating spatially-explicit genomic
data](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-01-tutorial.html) on real
geographic landscapes, however, it has grown to be much more than that
since then: *slendr* can now simulate data from [traditional,
non-spatial demographic
models](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-04-nonspatial-models.html)
using *msprime* as a simulation engine, and it even supports selection
scenarios via [user-defined SLiM estension
snippets](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-11-extensions.html). In
addition to model definition and simulation, *slendr* also provides a
set of function for efficient [analysis of tree-sequence genomic
data](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-05-tree-sequences.html),
utilizing the [*tskit*](https://tskit.dev) module for underlying
computation.

This page briefly summarizes *slendr*’s most important features. A more
detailed description of the *slendr* architecture and an extensive set
of practical code examples can be found in our
[paper](https://peercommunityjournal.org/articles/10.24072/pcjournal.354/)
in the PCI journal and on our [website](https://slendr.net).

### Main features

Here is a brief summary of *slendr*’s most important features. The R
package allows you to:

- **Program demographic models**, including population splits,
  population size changes, and gene-flow events **using an extremely
  simple declarative language entirely in R** ([see this
  vignette](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-04-nonspatial-models.html)
  for an example of the model-definition interface). Even complex models
  can be written with only a very little code and require only a bare
  minimum of R programming knowledge (the only thing the user needs to
  know is how to call an R function and what does an R data frame look
  like).

- Execute *slendr* models using **efficient, tailor-made SLiM or
  *msprime* simulation scripts** **which are bundled with the R
  package**. Both of these simulation engines save outputs in the form
  of an efficient tree-sequence data structure. **No SLiM or *msprime*
  programming is needed!**

- **Load, process, and analyse tree-sequence outputs** via *slendr*’s
  built-in R interface to the tree-sequence library
  [*tskit*](https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/)*.* You can compute many
  [population genetic
  statistics](https://slendr.net/reference/index.html#tree-sequence-statistics)
  in R immediately after the simulation finishes [directly on the output
  tree
  sequences](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-05-tree-sequences.html#calculating-f-statistics),
  without having to convert files to other formats (VCF, EIGENSTRAT) for
  analysis in different software.

- Although it originally assumed neutrality of simulated models,
  *slendr* now provides a simple extension mechanism for [customization
  of SLiM-based models using user-defined SLiM
  code](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-11-extensions.html).
  Simulations of selection models of arbitrary complexity is now
  entirely possible.

- [**Schedule sampling
  events**](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-05-tree-sequences.html#scheduling-of-sampling-events)
  which specify how many individuals’ genomes, from which populations,
  and at which times (optionally, at which locations) should be recorded
  by the simulation engine (SLiM or *msprime*) in the output
  tree-sequence files.

- **Encode complex models of population movements on a landscape** (see
  a brief example of such model
  [here](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-06-locations.html#model-specification),
  and a more extended explanation in [this
  tutorial](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-01-tutorial.html)). No
  knowledge of cartographic or geospatial analysis concepts is needed.

- **Simulate these dynamic spatial demographic models using SLiM’s
  continuous-space simulation capabilities directly in R** **(again, no
  SLiM programming required).** The outputs from such simulations are
  saved as tree sequences and can be analysed using [standard R
  geospatial data analysis
  libraries](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-09-paper.html#example-4-figure-5).
  This is because *slendr* performs the conversion of tree sequence
  tables to the appropriate spatial R data type automatically.

- Specify within-population individual [dispersal
  dynamics](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-03-interactions.html)
  from the R interface by leveraging SLiM’s individual interaction
  parameters implemented in the SLiM back-end script.

**Utilizing the flexibility of R with its wealth of libraries for
statistics, geospatial analysis and graphics, and combining it with the
power of population genetic simulation frameworks SLiM and *msprime*,
the *slendr* R package makes it possible to write entire simulation and
analytic pipelines without the need to leave the R environment.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Testing the R package in an online RStudio session

You can open an RStudio session and test examples from the
[vignettes](https://slendr.net/articles/) directly in your web browser
by clicking this button (no installation is needed!):

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/bodkan/slendr/main?urlpath=rstudio)

**In case the RStudio instance appears to be starting very slowly,
please be patient (Binder is a freely available service with limited
computational resources provided by the community).** If Binder crashes,
try reloading the web page, which will restart the cloud session.

Once you get a browser-based RStudio session, you can navigate to the
`vignettes/` directory and test the examples on your own!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Installation

*slendr* is now available CRAN which means that you can install it
simply by entering `install.packages("slendr")` into your R console.

If you would like to test the latest features of the software (perhaps
because you need some bug fixes), you can install it with
`devtools::install_github("bodkan/slendr")` (note that this requires the
R package *devtools*).

⚠️⚠️⚠️

**Note:** the default *slendr* installation no longer has a hard
dependency on geospatial R packages *sf*, *stars*, and *rnaturalearth*.
If you indend to use *slendr* for spatial genomic simulations and data
analysis, you have to run
`install.packages(c("sf", "stars", "rnaturalearth"))` first.

⚠️⚠️⚠️

### Example

Here is a very brief demonstration of the kind of spatial model which
*slendr* has been originally designed to simulate data from. Please note
that although this is a spatially-explicit population genetic model,
*slendr* has an extensive support for [traditional, non-spatial
simulations as
well](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-04-nonspatial-models.html).
Furthermore, this example only shows how to specify and simulate a model
in R. It doesn’t show how to analyse tree-sequence outputs and compute
population genetic statistics from them (this important feature is
demonstrated in [this
tutorial](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-05-tree-sequences.html#calculating-f-statistics)).

#### 1. Setup the spatial context

Imagine that we wanted to simulate spatio-temporal genomic data from a
toy model of the history of modern humans in West Eurasia after the Out
of Africa migration.

First, we define the spatial context of the simulation. This will
represent the “world” which will be occupied by populations in our
model.

``` r

library(slendr)

# this sets up internal Python environment and needs to be ran only once!
# (do not put this in your R scripts, run this command in the R console
# after you (re-)install slendr)
setup_env()

# activate the internal Python environment needed for simulation and
# tree-sequence processing
init_env()

map <- world(
  xrange = c(-13, 70), # min-max longitude
  yrange = c(18, 65),  # min-max latitude
  crs = "EPSG:3035"    # coordinate reference system (CRS) for West Eurasia
)
```

We can visualize the defined world map using the function `plot_map`
provided by the package.

``` r

plot_map(map)
```

![](reference/figures/README-plot_world-1.png)

Although in this example we use a real Earth landscape, the `map` can be
completely abstract (either blank or with user-defined landscape
features such as continents, islands, corridors and barriers).

#### 2. Define broader geographic regions

In order to make the definitions of population ranges (below) easier, we
can define smaller regions on the map using the function `region`.

Note that all coordinates in *slendr* are specified in the geographic
coordinate system (i.e., degrees longitude and latitude), but are
internally represented in a projected CRS (in our case, EPSG 3035 as
specified above).

This makes it easier for us to define spatial features simply by reading
the coordinates from a regular map but the internal projected CRS makes
simulations more accurate (distances and shapes are not distorted
because we can use a CRS tailored to the region of the world we are
working with). The projected CRS takes care of the projection of the
part of the world we’re interested in from the three-dimensional Earth
surface to a two-dimensional map.

``` r

africa <- region(
  "Africa", map,
  polygon = list(c(-18, 20), c(38, 20), c(30, 33),
                 c(20, 33), c(10, 38), c(-6, 35))
)
europe <- region(
  "Europe", map,
  polygon = list(
    c(-8, 35), c(-5, 36), c(10, 38), c(20, 35), c(25, 35),
    c(33, 45), c(20, 58), c(-5, 60), c(-15, 50)
  )
)
anatolia <- region(
  "Anatolia", map,
  polygon = list(c(28, 35), c(40, 35), c(42, 40),
                 c(30, 43), c(27, 40), c(25, 38))
)
```

Again, we can use the generic `plot_map` function to visualize these
objects, making sure we specified them correctly:

``` r

plot_map(africa, europe, anatolia)
```

![](reference/figures/README-plot_regions-1.png)

#### 3. Define demographic history and population boundaries

The most important function in the *slendr* package is
[`population()`](https://slendr.net/reference/population.md), which is
used to define names, split times, sizes and spatial ranges of
populations. Here, we specify times in years before the present,
distances in kilometers. If this makes more sense for your models, times
can also be given in a forward direction.

You will also note functions such as
[`move()`](https://slendr.net/reference/move.md) or
[`expand_range()`](https://slendr.net/reference/expand_range.md) which
are designed to take a *slendr* population object and schedule its
spatial dynamics at appropriate times during the model simulation (which
will happen at a later step).

Note that in order to make this example executable in a reasonable time
on my extremely old laptop, I decreased the sizes of all populations to
unrealistic levels. This will speed up the SLiM simulation at a later
step.

``` r

afr <- population( # African ancestral population
  "AFR", time = 52000, N = 3000, map = map, polygon = africa
)

ooa <- population( # population of the first migrants out of Africa
  "OOA", parent = afr, time = 51000, N = 500, remove = 25000,
  center = c(33, 30), radius = 400e3
) %>%
  move(
    trajectory = list(c(40, 30), c(50, 30), c(60, 40)),
    start = 50000, end = 40000, snapshots = 20
  )

ehg <- population( # Eastern hunter-gatherers
  "EHG", parent = ooa, time = 28000, N = 1000, remove = 6000,
  polygon = list(
    c(26, 55), c(38, 53), c(48, 53), c(60, 53),
    c(60, 60), c(48, 63), c(38, 63), c(26, 60))
)

eur <- population( # European population
  name = "EUR", parent = ehg, time = 25000, N = 2000,
  polygon = europe
)

ana <- population( # Anatolian farmers
  name = "ANA", time = 28000, N = 3000, parent = ooa, remove = 4000,
  center = c(34, 38), radius = 500e3, polygon = anatolia
) %>%
  expand_range( # expand the range by 2.500 km
    by = 2500e3, start = 10000, end = 7000,
    polygon = join(europe, anatolia), snapshots = 20
  )

yam <- population( # Yamnaya steppe population
  name = "YAM", time = 7000, N = 500, parent = ehg, remove = 2500,
  polygon = list(c(26, 50), c(38, 49), c(48, 50),
                 c(48, 56), c(38, 59), c(26, 56))
) %>%
  move(trajectory = list(c(15, 50)), start = 5000, end = 3000, snapshots = 10)
```

We can use the function `plot_map` again to get a “compressed” overview
of all spatio-temporal range dynamics encoded by the model so far (prior
to the simulation itself).

``` r

plot_map(afr, ooa, ehg, eur, ana, yam)
```

![](reference/figures/README-plot_popmaps-1.png)

#### 4. Define gene-flow events

By default, populations in *slendr* do not mix even if they are
overlapping. In order to schedule an gene-flow event between two
populations, we can use the function `gene_flow`. If we want to specify
multiple such events at once, we can collect these events in a simple R
list:

``` r

gf <- list(
  gene_flow(from = ana, to = yam, rate = 0.5, start = 6500, end = 6400, overlap = FALSE),
  gene_flow(from = ana, to = eur, rate = 0.5, start = 8000, end = 6000),
  gene_flow(from = yam, to = eur, rate = 0.75, start = 4000, end = 3000)
)
```

#### 5. Compile the model to a set of configuration files

Before we run the simulation, we compile all individual model components
(population objects and gene-flow events) to a single R object,
specifying some additional model parameters. Additionally, this performs
internal consistency checks, making sure the model parameters (split
times, gene flow times, etc.) make sense before the (potentially quite
computationally costly) simulation is even run.

``` r

model <- compile_model(
  populations = list(afr, ooa, ehg, eur, ana, yam), # populations defined above
  gene_flow = gf,
  generation_time = 30,
  resolution = 10e3,                   # resolution in meters per pixel
  competition = 130e3, mating = 100e3, # spatial interaction parameters
  dispersal = 70e3,                    # how far can offspring end up from their parents
)
```

Compiled model is kept as an R object which can be passed to different
functions. In this example, we will simulate data with the
[`slim()`](https://slendr.net/reference/slim.md) engine (but we could
also run the simulation through the coalescent engine via the
[`msprime()`](https://slendr.net/reference/msprime.md) function).

#### 6. Visualize the model

The package provides an [R shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/)-based browser
app [`explore_model()`](https://slendr.net/reference/explore_model.md)
for checking the model dynamics interactively and visually. For more
complex models, this is much better than static spatial plots such as
the one we showed in step 2 above:

``` r

explore_model(model)
```

The function has two modes:

1.  Plotting (and “playing”) spatial map dynamics:

![](reference/figures/shiny_maps.jpg)

2.  Displaying the demographic history graph (splits and gene-flow
    events) embedded in the specified model:

![](reference/figures/shiny_graph.jpg)

#### 7. Run the model in SLiM

Finally, we can execute the compiled model in SLiM. Here we run the
simulation in a batch mode, but we could also run it in SLiMgui by
setting `method = "gui"`. This would allow us to inspect the spatial
simulation as it happens in real time.

The `slim` function generates a complete SLiM script tailored to run the
spatial model we defined above. This saves you, the user, a tremendous
amount of time, because you don’t have to write new SLiM code every time
you design a new demographic model. The output of the simulation run
from any *slendr* model is always a [tree
sequence](https://tskit.dev/learn/), here loaded into an object
`ts_slim`.

``` r

ts_slim <- slim(model, sequence_length = 10e6, recombination_rate = 1e-8,
                method = "batch", random_seed = 314159)
```

As specified here, *slendr*’s SLiM backend will simulate 10 Mb of
sequence for each individual, and produce a tree sequence output from
the simulation run which can be analysed by many [built-in population
genetic
functions](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-05-tree-sequences.html#calculating-f-statistics).
By default, all individuals living at the end of the simulation are
recorded as samples in the tree sequence. If a specific set of samples
(ancient and modern) is needed, this can be defined accordingly using a
[dedicated
function](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-05-tree-sequences.html#scheduling-of-sampling-events).

Note that although we defined a spatial model, we could have just as
easily simulated standard, non-spatial data by running the same model
through *slendr*’s
[`msprime()`](https://slendr.net/reference/msprime.md) back end without
the need to make any changes:

``` r

ts_msprime <- msprime(model, sequence_length = 10e6, recombination_rate = 1e-8)
```

Here is a very quick overview of the SLiM simulation run summarised as a
GIF animation. Again, please note that the simulation is extremely
simplified. We only simulated a very small number of individuals in each
population, and we also didn’t specify any [dispersal
dynamics](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-03-interactions.html)
which is why the populations look so clumped.

``` r

animate_model(model = model, file = locations_file, steps = 50, width = 500, height = 300)
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): R: UnableToWritePixelCache `/var/folders/70/b_q2zdh116b9pfg29p03sx600000gn/T//RtmpyLwlps/magick-UHJ_3VsqZdrkY5sTCDUuYTjjSKmibs4k': No space left on device @ error/cache.c/WritePixelCachePixels/6023
```

At this point, you could either compute some [population genetic
statistics of
interest](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-05-tree-sequences.html#calculating-f-statistics)
or perhaps analyse the [spatial features of the
genealogies](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-06-locations.html#extracting-spatio-temporal-ancestral-relationships)
simulated by your model.

## Further information

The example above provides only a very brief and incomplete overview of
the full functionality of the *slendr* package. There is much more to
*slendr* than what we demonstrated here. For instance:

- You can tweak parameters influencing dispersal dynamics (how “clumpy”
  populations are, how far can offspring migrate from their parents,
  etc.) and define how these should change over time. For instance, you
  can see that in the animation above, the African population forms a
  single “blob” that really isn’t spread out across its entire
  population range. Tweaking the dispersal parameters as show [this
  vignette](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-03-interactions.html)
  helps avoid that.

- You can use *slendr* to program non-spatial models, which means that
  any conceivable traditional, random-mating demographic model can be
  simulated with only a few lines of R code. You can learn more in [this
  vignette](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-04-nonspatial-models.html)
  (and in more detail in [this
  vignette](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-05-tree-sequences.html)).
  Because SLiM simulations can be often quite slow compared to their
  coalescent counterparts, we also provide functionality allowing to
  simulate *slendr* models (without any change!) using a built-in
  *msprime* back end script. See [this
  vignette](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-07-backends.html) for a
  tutorial on how this works.

- You can extend traditional, non-spatial SLiM-based *slendr* models
  with customized SLiM code and [simulate various selection
  scenarios](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-11-extensions.html)
  supported by SLiM while still leveraging *slendr*’s easy-to-use
  interface for programming demographic models.

- You can build complex spatial models which are still abstract (not
  assuming any real geographic location), including traditional
  simulations of demes in a lattice structure. A complete example is
  shown [this
  vignette](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-02-grid-model.html).

- Because *slendr* & SLiM save data in a tree-sequence file format,
  thanks to the R package
  [*reticulate*](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) for
  interfacing with Python code, we have the full power of
  [*tskit*](https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/) and
  [*pyslim*](https://tskit.dev/pyslim/docs/latest/introduction.html) for
  manipulating tree-sequence data right at our fingertips, all within
  the convenient environment of R. An extended example can be found in
  [this
  vignette](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-05-tree-sequences.html).

- For spatially explicit population models, the *slendr* package
  automatically converts the simulated output data to a format which
  makes it possible to analyse it with many available R packages for
  geospatial data analysis. A brief description of this functionality
  can be found in [this
  vignette](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-06-locations.html).

- You can find complete reproducible code behind the examples in our
  [paper](https://peercommunityjournal.org/articles/10.24072/pcjournal.354/)
  in a dedicated R vignette
  [here](https://slendr.net/articles/vignette-09-paper.html).
