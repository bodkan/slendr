\title{Define sampling events for a given set of populations}
\usage{
sampling(model, times, ..., locations = NULL, strict = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Object of the class \code{slendr_model}}

\item{times}{Integer vector of times (in model time units) at which to
schedule remembering of individuals in the tree-sequence}

\item{...}{Lists of two elements (\code{slendr_pop} population object-<number
of individuals to sample), representing from which populations should how
many individuals be remembered at times given by \code{times}}

\item{locations}{List of vector pairs, defining two-dimensional coordinates
of locations at which the closest number of individuals from given
populations should be sampled. If \code{NULL} (the default), individuals
will be sampled randomly throughout their spatial boundary.}

\item{strict}{Should any occurence of a population not being present at a
given time result in an error? Default is \code{FALSE}, meaning that
invalid sampling times for any populations will be quietly ignored.}
}
\value{
Data frame with three columns: time of sampling, population to sample
from, how many individuals to sample
}
\description{
Schedule sampling events at specified times and, optionally, a given set of
locations on a landscape
}
\details{
If both times and locations are given, the the sampling will be scheduled on
each specified location in each given time-point. Note that for the
time-being, in the interest of simplicity, no sanity checks are performed on
the locations given except the restriction that the sampling points must fall
within the bounding box around the simulated world map. Other than that,
slendr will simply instruct its SLiM backend script to sample individuals as
close to the sampling points given as possible, regardless of whethere those
points lie within a population spatial boundary at that particular moment of
time.
