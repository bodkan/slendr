\title{Get a tree from a given tree sequence}
\usage{
ts_tree(ts, i, mode = c("index", "position"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{Tree sequence object of the class \code{slendr_ts}}

\item{i}{Position of the tree in the tree sequence. If \code{mode = "index"},
an i-th tree will be returned (in zero-based indexing as in tskit), if
\code{mode = "position"}, a tree covering the i-th base of the simulated genome will be
returned (again, in tskit's indexing).}

\item{mode}{How should the \code{i} argument be interpreted? Either "index"
as an i-th tree in the sequence of genealogies, or "position" along the
simulated genome.}

\item{...}{Additional keyword arguments accepted by
\code{tskit.TreeSequence.at and tskit.TreeSequence.at_index} methods}
}
\value{
Python-reticulate-based object of the class tskit.trees.Tree
}

# extract the zero-th tree in the tree sequence
tree <- ts_tree(ts, i = 0)

# extract the tree at a position in the tree sequence
