slim(
  model,
  sequence_length,
  recombination_rate,
  samples = NULL,
  output = NULL,
  burnin = 0,
  max_attempts = 1,
  spatial = !is.null(model$world),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model object created by the \code{compile} function}

\item{sequence_length}{Total length of the simulated sequence (in base-pairs)}

\item{recombination_rate}{Recombination rate of the simulated sequence (in
recombinations per basepair per generation)}

\item{samples}{A data frame of times at which a given number of individuals
should be remembered in the tree-sequence (see \code{schedule_sampling} for a
function that can generate the sampling schedule in the correct format). If
missing, only individuals present at the end of the simulation will be
recorded in the tree-sequence output file.}

\item{output}{Path to the output tree-sequence file. If \code{NULL} (the default),
tree sequence will be saved to a temporary file.}

\item{burnin}{Length of the burnin (in model's time units, i.e. years)}

\item{max_attempts}{How many attempts should be made to place an offspring
near one of its parents? Serves to prevent infinite loops on the SLiM
backend. Default value is 1.}

\item{spatial}{Should the model be executed in spatial mode? By default, if a
world map was specified during model definition, simulation will proceed in
a spatial mode.}

\item{coalescent_only}{Should \code{initializeTreeSeq(retainCoalescentOnly =
  <...>)} be set to \code{TRUE} (the default) or \code{FALSE}? See
"retainCoalescentOnly" in the SLiM manual for more detail.}

\item{method}{How to run the script? ("gui" - open in SLiMgui, "batch" - run
on the command line)}

\item{random_seed}{Random seed (if \code{NULL}, a seed will be generated between
0 and the maximum integer number available)}

\item{run}{Should the SLiM engine be run? If \code{FALSE}, the command line SLiM
command will be printed (and returned invisibly as a character vector) but not executed.}

\item{verbose}{Write the SLiM output log to the console (default
\code{FALSE})?}

\item{load}{Should the final tree sequence be immediately loaded and returned?
Default is \code{TRUE}. The alternative (\code{FALSE}) is useful when a tree-sequence
file is written to a custom location to be loaded at a later point.}

\item{locations}{If \code{NULL}, locations are not saved. Otherwise, the
path to the file where locations of each individual throughout the simulation
will be saved (most likely for use with \code{animate_model}).}

\item{slim_path}{Path to the appropriate SLiM binary (this is useful if the
\code{slim} binary is not on the \code{$PATH}). Note that this argument must
be specified if the function is being run on Windows.}
}
\value{
A tree-sequence object loaded via Python-R reticulate interface function \code{ts_load}
(internally represented by the Python object \code{tskit.trees.TreeSequence}). Optionally,
depending on the value of the arguments \code{load =} or \code{run =}, nothing or a character
vector, respectively.
}
\description{
This function will execute a SLiM script generated by the \code{compile}
function during the compilation of a slendr demographic model.
