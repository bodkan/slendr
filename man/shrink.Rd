\title{Shrink the population range}
\usage{
shrink(
  pop,
  by,
  end,
  start,
  overlap = 0.8,
  snapshots = NULL,
  lock = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{Object of the class \code{slendr_pop}}

\item{by}{How many units of distance to shrink by?}

\item{start, end}{When does the boundary shrinking start/end?}

\item{overlap}{Minimum overlap between subsequent spatial boundaries}

\item{snapshots}{The number of intermediate snapshots (overrides the
\code{overlap} parameter)}

\item{lock}{Maintain the same density of individuals. If
\code{FALSE} (the default), the number of individuals in the
population will not change. If \code{TRUE}, the number of
individuals simulated will be changed (increased or decreased)
appropriately, to match the new population range area.}

\item{verbose}{Report on the progress of generating intermediate spatial
boundaries?}
}
\value{
Object of the class \code{slendr_pop}
}
\description{
Shrinks the spatial population range by a specified distance in a given
time-window
}
