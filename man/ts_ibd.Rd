\usage{
ts_ibd(
  ts,
  coordinates = FALSE,
  within = NULL,
  between = NULL,
  squash = FALSE,
  minimum_length = NULL,
  maximum_time = NULL,
  sf = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{Tree sequence object of the class \code{slendr_ts}}

\item{coordinates}{Should coordinates of all detected IBD tracts be reported?
If \code{FALSE} (the default), only the total length of shared IBD segments
and their numbers are reported. If \code{TRUE}, coordinates of each segment
will be returned (but note that this can have a massive impact on memory
usage). See details for more information.}

\item{within}{A character vector with individual names or an integer vector with
node IDs indicating a set of nodes within which to look for IBD segments.}

\item{between}{A list of lists of character vectors with individual names or
integer vectors with node IDs, indicating a set of nodes between which to
look for shared IBD segments.}

\item{squash}{Should adjacent IBD segments for pairs of nodes be squashed if they
only differ by their 'genealogical paths' but not by their MRCA? Default is
\code{FALSE}. For more context, see \url{https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/issues/2459}.
This option is EXPERIMENTAL!}

\item{minimum_length}{Minimum length of an IBD segment to return in results.
This is useful for reducing the total amount of IBD returned (but see Details).}

\item{maximum_time}{Oldest MRCA of a node to be considered as an IBD ancestor
to return that IBD segment in results. This is useful for reducing the total
amount of IBD returned.}

\item{sf}{If IBD segments in a spatial tree sequence are being analyzed, should
the returned table be a spatial sf object? Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with IBD results (either coordinates of each IBD segment
shared by a pair of nodes, or summary statistics about the total IBD sharing
for that pair)
}
\description{
This function iterates over a tree sequence and returns IBD tracts between
pairs of individuals or nodes
}
\details{
This function is considered experimental. For full control over IBD segment
detection in tree-sequence data, users can (and perhaps, for the time being,
should) rely on the tskit method \code{ibd_segments}
(see \url{https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/python-api.html#tskit.TreeSequence.ibd_segments}).

Iternally, this function leverages the tskit \code{TreeSequence} method
\code{ibd_segments}. However, note that the \code{ts_ibd} function always
returns a data frame of IBD tracts, it does not provide an option to iterate
over individual IBD segments as shown in the official tskit documentation
at \url{https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/ibd.html}. In general, R handles
heavy iteration poorly, and this function does not attempt to serve as
a full wrapper to \code{ibd_segments}.

Unfortunately, the distinction between "squashed IBD" (what many would consider
to be the expected definition of IBD) and tskitâ€™s IBD which is defined via
distinct genealogical paths (see \url{https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/issues/2459}
for a discussion of the topic), makes the meaning of the filtering parameter
of the \code{ibd_segments()} method of tskit \code{minimum_length} somewhat
unintuitive. As of this moment, this function argument filters on IBD segments
on the tskit level, not the level of the squashed IBD segments!
