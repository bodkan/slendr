\arguments{
\item{populations}{Object(s) of the \code{slendr_pop} class (multiple objects need to be
specified in a \code{list})}

\item{dir}{Output directory for the model configuration files which will be loaded by the backend
SLiM script}

\item{generation_time}{Generation time (in model time units)}

\item{resolution}{How many distance units per pixel?}

\item{competition_dist, mate_dist}{Maximum spatial competition and mating choice distance}

\item{offspring_dist}{Standard deviation of the normal distribution of the parent-offspring
distance}

\item{geneflow}{Geneflow events generated by the \code{geneflow} function (either a list of
data.frame objects in the format defined by the \code{geneflow} function, or a single
data.frame)}

\item{overwrite}{Overwrite the contents of the output directory in case it already exists?}

\item{sim_length}{Total length of the simulation (if time is specified in a forward direction)}
}
\value{
Compiled \code{slendr_model} model object
}
\description{
First, compiles the vectorized population spatial maps into a series of binary raster PNG files,
which is the format that SLiM understands and uses it to define population boundaries. Then
extracts the demographic model defined by the user (i.e. population divergences and gene flow
events) into a series of tables which are later used by the built-in SLiM script to program the
timing of simulation events.
