\arguments{
\item{ts}{\code{pyslim.SlimTreeSequence} object}

\item{mode}{The mode for the calculation ("sites" or "branch")}

\item{span_normalise}{Divide the result by the span of the window? Default
TRUE, see the tskit documentation for more detail.}

\item{windows}{Coordinates of breakpoints between windows. The first
coordinate (0) and the last coordinate (equal to \code{ts$sequence_length})
do not have to be specified as they are added automatically.}

\item{W, X, Y, Z, A, B, C, O}{Character vectors of individual names (following the
nomenclature of Patterson et al. 2021)}
