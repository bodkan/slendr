\title{Extract genotypes from the tree sequence in the EIGENSTRAT format}
\usage{
ts_eigenstrat(ts, prefix, chrom = "chr1", outgroup = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{\code{pyslim.SlimTreeSequence} object}

\item{prefix}{EIGENSTRAT trio prefix}

\item{chrom}{The name of the chromosome in the EIGENSTRAT snp file
(default "chr1")}

\item{outgroup}{Should a formal, artificial outgroup be added? If \code{NULL}
(default), no outgroup is added. A non-NULL character name will serve as
the name of the outgroup in an ind file.}
}
\value{
Object of the class EIGENSTRAT created by the admixr package
}
\description{
EIGENSTRAT data produced by this function can be used by the admixr R package
(\url{https://bodkan.net/admixr/}).
}
\details{
In case an outgroup was not formally specified in a slendr model which
generated the tree sequence data, it is possible to artificially create an
outgroup sample with the name specified by the \code{outgroup} argument,
which will carry all ancestral alleles (i.e. value "2" in a geno file
for each position in a snp file).

\examples{
\dontrun{ # save genotypes as a trio of files eigenprefix.snp, eigenprefix.ind, eigenprefix.geno
ts_eigenstrat(ts, prefix = "/path/to/eigenprefix")
