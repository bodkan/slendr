\title{Plot a graphical representation of a single tree}
\usage{
ts_draw(
  x,
  width = 1500,
  height = 500,
  labels = FALSE,
  sampled_only = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A single tree extracted by \code{\link{ts_tree}}}

\item{width, height}{Pixel dimensions of the rendered bitmap}

\item{labels}{Label each node with the individual name?}

\item{sampled_only}{Should only individuals explicitly sampled through
simplification be labeled? This is relevant in situations in which sampled
individuals can themselves be among the ancestral nodes.}

\item{...}{Keyword arguments to the tskit \code{draw_svg} function.}
}
\description{
This function first obtains an SVG representation of the tree by calling the
\code{draw_svg} method of tskit and renders it as a bitmap image in R. All of
the many optional keyword arguments of the \code{draw_svg} method can be
provided and will be automatically passed to the method behind the scenes.
