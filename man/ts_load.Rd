\usage{
ts_load(
  file,
  model,
  recapitate = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to a tree-sequence file generated by SLiM}

\item{model}{Object of the class \code{slendr_model}}

\item{recapitate}{Should the tree-sequence be recapitated?}

\item{simplify}{Should the tree-sequence be simplified down to only
remembered (i.e. "sampled", in slendr parlance) individuals?}

\item{recombination_rate, Ne}{Arguments passed to \code{ts_recapitate}}
}
\value{
SlimTreeSequence object
}
\description{
This function loads a tree-sequence file simulated from a given slendr model.
Optionally, the tree-sequence can be recapitated and simplified.
}
\details{
The loading, recapitation and simplification is performed using the Python
module pyslim which serves as a link between tree-sequences generated by SLiM
and the tskit module for manipulation of tree-sequence data. All of these
steps have been modelled after the official pyslim tutorial and documentation
available at: \url{https://pyslim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html}.

The recapitation and simplification steps can also be performed individually
using the functions \code{ts_recapitate} and \code{ts_simplify}.
