\title{Compute the allele frequency spectrum (AFS)}
\usage{
ts_afs(
  ts,
  sample_sets = NULL,
  mode = c("site", "branch", "node"),
  windows = NULL,
  span_normalise = TRUE,
  polarised = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{\code{pyslim.SlimTreeSequence} object}

\item{sample_sets}{A list (optionally a named list) of character vectors with
individual names (one vector per set). If NULL, allele frequency spectrum
for all individuals in the tree sequence will be computed.}

\item{mode}{The mode for the calculation ("sites" or "branch")}

\item{windows}{Coordinates of breakpoints between windows. The first
coordinate (0) and the last coordinate (equal to \code{ts$sequence_length})
are added automatically)}

\item{polarised}{When FALSE (the default) the allele frequency spectrum will
be folded (i.e. the counts will not depend on knowing which allele is
ancestral)}
}
\value{
Either a single Fst value or a vector of Fst values (one for each
window)
}
\description{
This function computes the AFS with respect to the given set of individuals
}
\details{
For more information on the format of the result and dimensions, in
particular the interpretation of the first and the last element of the AFS,
