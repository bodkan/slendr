\title{Simplify the tree sequence down to a given set of individuals}
\usage{
ts_simplify(ts, simplify_to = NULL, spatial = TRUE, keep_input_roots = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{Tree sequence object of the class \code{slendr_ts}}

\item{simplify_to}{A character vector of individual names. If NULL, all
explicitly remembered individuals (i.e. those specified via the
\code{\link{sampling}} function will be left in the tree sequence after the
simplification.}

\item{spatial}{Should spatial information encoded in the tree sequence data
be converted to spatial R datastructures? If FALSE, pixel-based
raster-dimensions will not be converted to the coordinate reference system
implied by the model. If TRUE (default), reprojection of coordinates will
be performed. If the model was non-spatial, the value of this parameter is
disregarded.}

\item{keep_input_roots}{Should the history ancestral to the MRCA of all
samplbee retained in the tree sequence? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Tree sequence object of the class \code{slendr_ts}
}
\description{
This function is a convenience wrapper around the \code{simplify} method
implemented in tskit, designed to work on tree sequence data simulated by
SLiM using the \pkg{slendr} R package.
}
\details{
The simplification process is used to remove redundant information from the
tree sequence and retains only information necessary to describe the
genealogical history of a set of samples.

For more information on how simplification works in pyslim and tskit, see the
official documentation at
\url{https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/python-api.html#tskit.TreeSequence.simplify}
and
\url{https://tskit.dev/pyslim/docs/latest/tutorial.html#simplification}.

A very clear description of the difference between remembering and retaining
and how to use these techniques to implement historical individuals (i.e.
ancient DNA samples) is in the pyslim documentation at
\url{https://tskit.dev/pyslim/docs/latest/tutorial.html#historical-individuals}.
