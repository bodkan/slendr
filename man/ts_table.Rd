\title{Get the table of individuals/nodes/edges/mutations from the tree sequence}
\usage{
ts_table(ts, table = c("individuals", "edges", "nodes", "mutations"))
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{Tree sequence object of the class \code{slendr_ts}}

\item{table}{Which tree sequence table to return}
}
\value{
Data frame with the information from the give tree sequence table
}
\description{
This function extracts data from a given tree sequence table. All times are
converted to model-specific time units from tskit's "generations backwards"
time direction.
}
\details{
For further processing and analyses, the output of the function
\code{\link{ts_nodes}} might be more useful, as it merges the information in
node and individual tables into one table and further annotates it with
useful information from the model configuration data.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{ts_nodes}} and \code{\link{ts_edges}} for accessing an
annotated, more user-friendly and analysis-friendly treee sequence table
data
