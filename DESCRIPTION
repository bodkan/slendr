Description: A framework for simulating spatially-explicit genomic
    data which leverages real cartographic information to programmatically
    and visually encode spatial population boundaries and temporal dynamics
    across a real geographic landscape, and specify population divergences
    and geneflow events based on an arbitrary graph of demographic history.
    Models specified by the package are then automatically executed by the
    'SLiM' software behind the scenes, using a custom built-in 'SLiM' script.
    In addition to models on real geographic landscape, fully abstract spatial
    models are also supported, but the users can also simulate data from
    traditional non-spatial models. Simulated sequence data is saved in
    a tree-sequence format and can be loaded, manipulated and summarised using
    tree-sequence functionality provided by Python modules 'tskit' and
    'pyslim', all without having to leave the R interface.
