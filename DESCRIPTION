Description: A framework for simulating spatially-explicit genomic
    data which leverages real cartographic information for programmatic
    and visual encoding of spatial population boundaries and temporal dynamics
    across a real geographic landscape, specify population divergences
    and encode gene flow events based on an arbitrary graph of demographic history.
    Such population genetic models are then automatically executed by the
    'SLiM' software behind the scenes, using a custom built-in simulation 'SLiM'
    script. Additionally, fully abstract spatial models not tied to a specific
    geographic location are supported, and users can also simulate data from
    standard, non-spatial, random-mating models. These can be simulated either
    with the 'SLiM' built-in back end script, or using a much more efficient
    coalescent population genetics simulator 'msprime' with a custom-built
    Python script bundled with the R package. Simulated sequence data
    is saved in a tree-sequence format and can be loaded, manipulated, and
    summarised using tree-sequence functionality via an R interface to the
    Python module 'tskit'. Thus, complete model configuration, simulation and
    analysis pipelines can be constructed without a need to leave the
    R environment, eliminating friction between disparate tools for population
    genetics and genome analysis and facilitating reproducible research.
