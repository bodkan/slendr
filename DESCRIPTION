Description: A framework for simulating spatially-explicit genomic
    data which leverages real cartographic information to programmatically
    and visually encode spatial population boundaries and temporal dynamics
    (i.e., population displacements and expansions) across a real geographic
    landscape, and specify population divergences and gene flow events based
    on an arbitrary admixture graph. Spatial demographic models are then
    compiled into a custom-built SLiM script which can be extended by
    the user to perform arbitrary simulations.
