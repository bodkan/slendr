# This script tests that models with times going "into the future" give the same result when
# run through both SLiM and msprime. This has been prompted by strange errors like
# "negative times not valid" from msprime when running models like this. This was caused
# by convert_to_forward() missing the following clause (ignoring special treatment of
# "forward" direction models entirely):
#     else if (direction == "forward")
#        times[times != -1] <- times[times != -1] - start_time + generation_time
# The reason why this wasn't discovered earlier is that the change only manifests in more
# complicated forward models (and only when run through msprime).
#
# These kinds of unit tests are also done elsewhere but those clearly have not been
# exhaustive enough -- it's better to put new tests in a separate script so that it's
# cleare why have these been introduced.
