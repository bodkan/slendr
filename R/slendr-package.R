#' Population Genetics Simulations Spanning Time And Space
#'
#' The \emph{slendr} package provides a framework for simulating
#' spatially-explicit genomic data. It leverages real Earth cartographic
#' information (or, alternatively, any kind of abstract spatial landscape) to
#' programmatically and visually encode spatial population boundaries and
#' temporal dynamics (i.e., population displacements and expansions) across a
#' geographic landscape, and specify population divergences and gene flow
#' events. Spatial demographic models are then compiled into a custom-built SLiM
#' script which can be extended by the user to perform arbitrary simulations.
#'
#' You can find installation instructions, reference manual, and tutorials at
#' <https://www.slendr.net>.
